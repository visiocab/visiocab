# Visiocab
_Visiocab_ (visual vocabulary) is a web application designed for use in higher education. Using 360° virtual tour media, visiocabs turn the class field trip something instructors and students can experience from anywhere. It provides an environment in which students can engage with content in a memorable way, or learn by creating their own visiocab to display their grasp of the subject matter.
